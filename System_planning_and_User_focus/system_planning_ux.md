#### Background knowledge:
#### Question 1: What does it mean to install a program on your computer?

Installing a program refers to the act of making a program executable within the computer it is being "installed" in.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### There are different operating systems available for users such as Windows, Linux and OS. Research how software is installed in these three operating systems.
#### Question 2: Describe the differences and similarities between the installation process for software that you found in your research. ü§ìRemember to add the citation for your sources.

Currently, the simplest and most prominent source of installable software accross Windows and MacOS operating systems is from the internet, where programs that are tailor made for these systems can be found and dowloaded to be installed.
On the other hand, installing software for Linux is typically done through software repositories, which are public servers that host installable software packages.

To install software from the internet on Windows and MacOS, files are downloaded (.exe for Windows, .zip, .dmg, or .pkg for MacOS) and usually instructions are given to aid
the user in completing the installation process. For Linux software, programs can be directly installed from repositories through the Linux command line. The exact command differs
based on repository, but it typically will look something like this:
$ sudo (command for each repository) install (software from said repository)
