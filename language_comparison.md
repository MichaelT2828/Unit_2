## Python and C Reflection

Through learning Python in Unit 1, and switching over to C for my Unit 2 project, I have found many differences between the two languages. Personally,
I found Python to be much more intuitive, while the syntax of C was much more complex and had to be precise. An example would be switching an integer to a string
or the other way around, which is very simple in Python requiring a simple int() or str(). However, in C a simple switch requires the sprintf() function, with a very
specific syntax of (pointer to string, "%f" to specify the value is a floating point integer (I will be honest I still don't really understand this part), pointer to integer variable).

While the syntax and learning curve of C might be more difficult, C is a structure oriented programming language, which means it is more useful in programming the computer on
a hardware level. It may lack the many built in functions characteristic of higher-level languages such as Python, but as a result is more optimized for low memory management
and is less taxing on the computer. 

However, I still much prefer Python over C, as I feel I am more able to focus on the critical thinking to solve problems part of programming rather than scrolling through online forums
trying to find the right syntax for a seemingly trivial task. I have thought to myself many times throughout my Unit 2 project, "this task would be so much simpler in Python", and while I understand
the value learning C brings to my programming experience, programming in Python is still a much more rewarding experience.
